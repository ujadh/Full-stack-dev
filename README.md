<!-- >The partition of the project refers to the distribution of the project to clear sub-assemblies and similar executions (subprojects, phases, tasks and tasks). >> The progress of research and development projects is characterized by the formation of the outcome and the step of focusing the Gate by step. The partition of the project should be based on this starting point (also applies to>> IT Institute's student projects).

>The project life cycle can be divided into different types of phases. At each stage, certain products are produced, such as a statement, plans, prototype, device, etc. to the end of each stage to complete evaluation, acceptance or review. The software project is typically divided into seven steps: establishment, pre-study, analysis, design, implementation, testing and quitting. Sometimes a preliminary study has its own project, sometimes analysis is included in design, etc. Testing may not necessarily have its own phase, but is included in all stages. Often proceeded incrementally, ie first planned and implemented one thing in its entirety before proceeding to the next issue. There is no single "correct" phase distribution, but if the commissioner has its own method and related templates, both student projects are primarily used. More often, agile application development is used, that is, the software is made in 1-4 weeks sprints. -->

### Phases in the Software Project Life Cycle:
- **Establishment:**
    - Initial phase focusing on project initiation and definition.
    - Identification of project goals, objectives, and stakeholders.
    - High-level planning and estimation.
- **Pre-Study:**
    - An optional phase for in-depth research and feasibility analysis.
    - Exploration of potential solutions, technologies, and project viability.
    - Preliminary understanding of the project scope.
- **Analysis:**
    - Detailed analysis of project requirements.
    - Gathering and documenting user needs and expectations.
    - Creation of requirement specifications.
- **Design:**
    - Development of a comprehensive design plan.
    - Architectural and detailed design of the software system.
    - Prototyping and visualization of the system.
- **Implementation:**
    - Actual coding and development of the software.
    - Translating design specifications into executable code.
    - Frequent collaboration and communication among developers.
- **Testing:**
    - Verification and validation of the developed software.
    - Systematic testing to identify and fix bugs and errors.
    - Ensuring the software meets specified requirements.
- **Closing (Quitting):**
    - Final phase involving project evaluation, acceptance, or review.
    - Documentation of project outcomes and lessons learned.
    - Handover of the completed project to the client or end-users.

### Iterative and Incremental Development:
- **Incremental Approach:**
    - Often, projects proceed incrementally, completing one segment before moving to the next.
    - Each increment represents a fully functional and tested portion of the overall project.
- **Agile Methodology:**
    - Agile application development is commonly used.
    - Work is organized into short iterations or sprints (1-4 weeks).
    - Emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness to changing requirements.
### Flexibility in Phase Distribution:
- **Adaptation to Project Needs:**
    - There's no universal "correct" phase distribution.
    - Tailoring the approach to fit the specific needs and characteristics of the project is common.
    - The client or commissioner's method and templates may influence the chosen distribution.

## 4. Quality assurance

<!-- >Working methods, instruments, instructions and standards applicable in the project. This section lists all the methods, tools and standards to be used in version numbers. Often the commissioner has a method of complying with the project team. The client can also determine the appellants to be followed. Otherwise, the project team will tailor the model approved by the IT Institute's template for themselves and approved by the client. The course sets certain requirements for project monitoring tools and reporting that should be taken into account. However, the course does not forced a certain way to use tools, so there is a need to make a plan for this. The basics of information and version management of the project must be clarified so that all project stakeholders know the location of the latest versions of the documents. From the project plan and all other key documents of the project will become several versions that need to be added to the history history to monitor the development of the project afterwards. If a single device or software rises to the critical position of the project's implementation, it is good to designate this person who knows the person who knows. From the device or software group best. Here's a list of things that you should design and document:##  -->

Establishing a clear set of working methods, tools, instructions, and standards is crucial for the successful execution of a project. Below is a list of things that should be designed, documented, and communicated to ensure effective project management:

## 4.4 Risk management

<!-- >Listing the risks, evaluate their severity and probability and to think about thinking about how the most serious / most likely risks could be prevented in advance.It would also be good to be a plan for how to work if the risk is implemented.
>Books the risks to the project below and maintain them as needed.For each risk, a unique identifier is given, for example, RIS007, as this will facilitate their treatment in different situations. -->

Risk management is a crucial component of project planning and execution, aimed at identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential risks that may impact the success of a project. Here are key aspects of risk management:

### 4.4.1 Risk Identification:
**Process:** Identify potential risks that could affect the project. This includes internal and external factors that may arise during the project lifecycle.

**Tools:** Risk brainstorming sessions, checklists, historical data analysis, and expert judgment.
### 4.4.2 Risk Assessment:
**Process:** Evaluate the likelihood and impact of identified risks. Prioritize risks based on their significance to the project.

**Tools:** Risk probability and impact matrices, risk categorization, quantitative risk analysis (if applicable).
### 4.4.3 Risk Mitigation Planning:
**Process:** Develop strategies to reduce the likelihood or impact of identified risks. This involves creating action plans and allocating resources.

**Tools:** Risk mitigation workshops, risk response planning, risk avoidance, risk transfer, risk acceptance.
### 4.4.4 Risk Monitoring and Control:
**Process:** Regularly monitor identified risks, assess their status, and implement contingency plans if necessary. Adjust the risk management plan as the project progresses.

**Tools:** Risk tracking, periodic risk reviews, key performance indicators (KPIs) related to risk management.
### 4.4.5 Contingency Planning:
**Process:** Develop contingency plans for high-impact risks. These plans outline specific actions to be taken if a risk event occurs.

**Tools:** Contingency planning workshops, scenario analysis, crisis management planning.
### 4.4.6 Risk Documentation:
**Process:** Maintain a comprehensive record of identified risks, assessments, mitigation strategies, and outcomes. This documentation serves as a reference and contributes to organizational learning.

**Tools:** Risk registers, risk logs, lessons learned documentation.
### 4.4.7 Risk Ownership:
**Process:** Assign ownership of specific risks to individuals or teams. This ensures accountability and clarity regarding who is responsible for monitoring and managing each risk.

**Tools:** Risk responsibility matrices, clear roles and responsibilities.
### 4.4.8 Risk Response Evaluation:
**Process:** Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented risk responses. Determine if the risk has been mitigated to an acceptable level or if further action is needed.

**Tools:** Post-implementation reviews, feedback mechanisms.
### 4.4.9 Risk Tolerance and Thresholds:
**Process:** Define the organization's risk tolerance level and thresholds. Establish criteria for determining when a risk becomes unacceptable and triggers specific actions.

**Tools:** Risk appetite statements, risk threshold definition.
### 4.4.10 External Risks Consideration:
**Process:** Acknowledge and assess external risks that may be beyond the direct control of the project team. Develop strategies for dealing with external uncertainties.

**Tools:** Environmental scanning, scenario planning.
